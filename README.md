# Dotfiles
My dotfiles for zsh, homebrew, homebrew-cask, OS X settings, etc.

## Credits
Some of the things and ideas in this repo is taken from others:
* [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) and his [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) for the excellent ~/.osx (I have customized mine, though)
