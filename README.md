# Dotfiles
My dotfiles for zsh, homebrew, homebrew-cask, OS X settings, etc.

## Installation
Clone the repo and run bootstrap.sh (The script will rsync dotfiles and the Library folder containing sublime settings to home folder)

## Credits
* [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens) and his [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles) for .osx and bootstrap.sh (I have customized mine)
